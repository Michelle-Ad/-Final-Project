            <h2>About PlantFashion</h2>
            <p>Fashion and living plants have always had a close <br/>relationship, with designers often using plant-based <br/>materials in their garments and accessories. But one<br/>
                creative has taken this relationship to a whole new level by<br/> creating a range of living pants that can be worn on the catwalk.</p>

                the team behind the project have created a range of garments <br/>

                more about this innovative project.</p>

                                number of others. Subsequent studies have been extremely variable, at best.</p>
